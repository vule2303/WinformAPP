# String resource file
#
# When processed by the String Resource Tool, this file generates
# both a .CS and a .RESX file with the same name as the file.
# The .CS file contains a class which can be used to access these
# string resources, including the ability to format in
# parameters, which are identified with the .NET {x} format
# (see String.Format help).
#
# Comments below assume the file name is SR.strings.
#
# Lines starting with a semicolon ";" are also treated as comments
